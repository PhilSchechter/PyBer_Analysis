#PyBer_Analysis, analyis by city type
DA course, module 5

##Purpose of this analysis

PyBer operates in 3 types of markets - Urban, Suburban,and Rural. This project looks at some key metrics by market type, to see
- where should we be allocating resources based on current results
- are there any initiatives we can take relative to these markets to gain a competitive advantage

##Result highlights

[City Type Summary](Analysis/CityTypeSummary.PNG)

As seen in the attached chart
- the bulk of revenues and drivers are Urban
- Rural has the smallest share, but the highest
-- the average fare per ride
-- average fare per driver
- Subuarban is significant, has higher per Ride, per Driver fares than urban

[Weekly by Type](Analysis/PyBer_far_summary.PNG)

Looking at the weekly fares by type, all three markets show peeks and valleys at the same time, and of similar dollar magnitudes, but as a percentage, these are much greater swings for the rural market; e.g. the swing between $100 and $400 is much greater percentage wise than the swing from $2000 to $2300.


##Summary - 3 recommendations

###Urban Ride Sharing: 

The urban market is out strongest, but the average fare per driver is low - we should take a look and see if that is impacting our driver retention rate. Potential: can we organize multple-person rides, give some discount to the customer for the inconvenience but get a higher overall pay-rate to the driver by driving multiple people at onece.

###Suburban Sweet Spot

Fare per ride and fare per driver are attractive in this market, and this accounts for aboiut 30% of our revenue. Would be ideal if we could expand this business without a fundamental strategy change, using targetted advertising.

###Rural Roller Coaster

While this is a small portion of the business, the fare per ride and fare per driver make this an appealing market, as trips will typically be long. However, results vary substantially week to week, which could make it hard for a driver to stick with us - some weeks they will see little activitiy.

If we could schedule activity on a regular basis, we may be able to stabilize this pattern. For example offer some discount for repeated rides. For allow the customer a 15% discount to prepay for a trip every-other week to the supermarket at a pre-determined time. This would cut in to the fare per ride, but would help smooth out the lulls in demand, and could potentially increase overall PyBer usage.
